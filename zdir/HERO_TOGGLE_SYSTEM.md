```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management

```tsx
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<ViewMode>("patience");
```

### Toggle Switch Component

- Two buttons with shared `layoutId="activeView"`
- Active state changes background with gradient
- Smooth spring transition between states
- Hover states for inactive buttons

### Content Switching

```tsx
<AnimatePresence mode="wait">
  {viewMode === "patience" ? <PatienceContent /> : <OrganizationContent />}
</AnimatePresence>
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Visual Feedback

2. **Hover feedback**: Gray text turns blue on hover
3. **Icons**: User icon vs Heart icon for quick recognition
4. **Smooth transitions**: No jarring changes

### Interaction Flow

1. User lands on page → Sees Patience's profile by default

- Hover: `hover:bg-brand-50` (light blue)

### Organization Mode (Cyan Theme)
