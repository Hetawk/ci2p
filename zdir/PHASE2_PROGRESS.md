## 💡 Quick Decision Point

Given the scope, I recommend:

**Option A: Complete Resources First (Recommended)**

- Finish all Resources APIs
- Integrate Resources page
- Then move to Team/Users
- **Advantage:** One complete feature at a time

**Option B: Do All APIs First**

- Create all remaining API endpoints
- Then do all frontend integrations
- **Advantage:** Backend-first approach

**Option C: Minimal Viable Product**

- Just create the essential GET endpoints
- Basic frontend integration
- Skip booking system for now
- **Advantage:** Fastest to "working" state

Which approach would you prefer? Or shall I continue with Option A?
