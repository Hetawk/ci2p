# 📋 Complete Project Status - October 10, 2025

## ✅ Session Accomplishments

### What We Fixed & Built Today

#### 🔧 Critical Error Fixes (Completed)

1. **Next.js 15 Async Params** - All 3 detail page APIs migrated
   - Changed `{ params: { id: string } }` to `{ params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`
   - Fixed GET, PUT, DELETE methods in news, papers, projects APIs
2. **Hero Component** - Created missing homepage hero section
   - Dual-mode design (Patience/Organization views)
   - Responsive with quick stats
3. **Resources API** - Removed unsupported Prisma features

#### 🎯 Phase 2: Resources & Bookings (55% Complete)

**✅ COMPLETED - All Backend APIs:**

1. **Resources List API** (`/api/resources/route.ts`)

   - GET: Paginated list with filters (type, status, bookable, search)
   - POST: Admin-only resource creation
   - Includes active bookings and availability

2. **Resources Detail API** (`/api/resources/[id]/route.ts`)

   - GET: Single resource with booking history
   - PUT: Admin update resource
   - DELETE: Admin delete (prevents if active bookings)

3. **Bookings List API** (`/api/resources/bookings/route.ts`)

   - GET: User bookings (admins see all, users see own)
   - POST: Create booking with conflict detection
   - Validates availability, time ranges, prevents double-booking

4. **Bookings Detail API** (`/api/resources/bookings/[id]/route.ts`)
   - GET: View booking (owner/admin)
   - PUT: Update booking (owner: limited, admin: full)
   - DELETE: Cancel booking
   - PATCH: Approve/Reject (admin only)

## 📊 Overall Project Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Detail Pages (100% Complete)

- Papers detail page with API integration
- Projects detail page with API integration
- News detail page with API integration
- All have view tracking, error handling, loading states

### 🟡 Phase 2: Resources System (55% Complete)

- ✅ Backend APIs (100% done - 4 endpoints)
- ⏳ Frontend integration (0% - next task)
- Remaining: Resources page UI

### ⏳ Phase 3: Users/Team (Not Started)

- Need: Users List API
- Need: User Detail API
- Need: Team listing page
- Need: Team detail page

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Option A: Complete Resources Feature First (RECOMMENDED)

**Time: ~45 minutes**

1. Integrate Resources page (`/app/(public)/resources/page.tsx`)
   - Replace mock data with API calls
   - Add booking modal/form
   - Display availability status
   - Show active bookings
   - Filter by type, status
2. Test complete Resources + Bookings workflow

**Why**: Delivers one complete feature before moving on

### Option B: Continue with Users/Team APIs

**Time: ~90 minutes**

1. Create Users List API (`/api/users/route.ts`)
2. Create User Detail API (`/api/users/[id]/route.ts`)
3. Integrate Team pages

**Why**: Complete all backend APIs, then all frontend

### Option C: Quick Remaining APIs, Skip Complex Frontend

**Time: ~1 hour**

1. Create basic Users APIs (GET only)
2. Simple Team page integrations (no complex features)

**Why**: Fastest to "complete" all features
